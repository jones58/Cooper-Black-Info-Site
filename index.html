          <p>
            In 1919, Oswald "Oz" Cooper set out to make an extra bold
            Roman typeface, drawing inspiration from his earlier work
            Cooper Old Style. Cooper Black was officially released in
            1922 by Barnhart Brothers & Spindler Type Founders. Cooper
            Black was immediately popular in advertising and newspaper
            headlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The typeface's distinctiveness lies in its bold and
            soft-edged design with prominently featured serifs (the
            curved bit on the edge of the font) made Cooper Black a
            versatile and friendly typeface. Unlike other flat-bottomed
            fonts at the time, Cooper Black had curved bottom edges
            which made it very forgiving to irregularities. This meant
            it didn't need to be laid in a perfect straight line to
            look "right". This suited the printing format of the early
            twentieth century, as using wood and metal type led to many
            printing errors. Another remarkable feature of Cooper Black
            is the tilt of the letters "o" and "q", with the slightly
            tilted vertical stress leading to a unique aesthetic which
            combines well with the other letters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to its success, Cooper Black spawned many copycats,
            which led Oswald Cooper to attempt to patent the typeface
            in 1930, but he faced legal obstacles as it was deemed to
            resemble a pre-existing logo.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Oswald's death in 1940, the typeface fell into
            relative obscurity before witnessing a resurgence in the
            1960s and 70s due to new forms of printing - phototype and
            letraset - which made it easier to squish the letters
            together. In this new environment, Cooper Black flourished,
            becoming popular in adverts, albums covers and film
            posters.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Oswald could never have prediced its renewed success
            - he often remarked that it looked best when kerned and
            leaded tight - in other words, not much space between each
            of the letters and each of the lines. This was very
            difficult to do with the old forms of printing (woodtype
            and metaltype) and much easier in letraset and phototype.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cooper Black's ready availability in Letraset also allowed
            it to be embraced by DIY graphic designers, who used it for
            anti-war protest posters, underground magazines, and other
            countercultural expressions.

            In 1966, its use in the title font of The Beach Boys'
            iconic album "Pet Sounds" catapulted Cooper Black into the
            cultural spotlight. It continued to gain traction, becoming
            the go-to font for novelty T-shirt designers and retaining
            its popularity among business owners who appreciate its
            friendly and familiar qualities for their signage.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1995, the UK budget airline easyJet chose Cooper Black
            for its branding, ensuring that this typeface continues to
            leave its mark on design history, even decades after its
            release.
